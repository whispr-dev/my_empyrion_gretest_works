[b]Offence and Defence[/b]

The ship comes with 4 railguns and 2 turrets.
- There are twin armoured cockpits sunk into the front armour making them a bit harder to hit.
- Hull material is... engines - there is no monocoque hull, instead the components form the framework and the ship is only made of separate steel plating where ablative armour is present.
- The ship is designed to take some hits and does part seperation/redundacy as well as an additional front layer of protection.
- It can be used to take on light POI's but expect some damage from hits.


[b]Performance[/b]

- all engine design - no hull design saves weight immensely - engines attach to engines around a central armoured core
- special hybrid alien tech Levit8™ Aero Ablative armour aerodynamic shaping reduces drag.
- much fuels

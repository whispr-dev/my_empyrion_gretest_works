[Vanilla:]
carries 5.01kt with no performance loss.
even can dust off full speed with 3.59kt on light gravity planets!

min 22.1mN thrust on weakest axes, yet only weighs 87.5t no cargo (and yes, it has internal cargo capability aplenty as well as external mounts), means this thing is [i][b]HYPER[/b]fast[/i].

incredible pitch, roll, and yaw specs mean this thing flies better than any fighter in the fleet - even a woflcorp. modded X-Wing Starfighter!

less than 14x11x7m means it fis in pretty much any CV hangar known making it the ultimate dropship/shuttle.
in fact, you can fit two of em in a std. woflcorp ind. 30x15x10m freighter shipping crate! [i](this may prove convenient for more than just delivery commercially...)[/i]

[note: "Thrusters Left/Right" should read "2/2" - damn thing glitched gfx /shrug. it also blanked the attacc/defens n a few others - weird...]

don't be deceived by the triangle count - what isn't win or cockpit is thrusters - i.e. faster throughput than the actual air flow aerodynamically over the skin would be - in other words most of what is 'square' speeds this thing up, not slows it down!


pls. note i emphasised strafe over yaw immensely so that's why it's the weakest spec of the three manoeverings. the pitch and roll are immense still. :D


nb. meant fo fast in'n'outs - rescues, dropship duties, shuttling etc. - it carries a hefty buncha fuel, but it eats a hefty buncha fuels - you aint got long between refuels. inflight refuelling or filling cargos/increasing fuels as option expansion is wise.
in vanilla, since  there are no caps/chargers,  there's a [b]hecc[/b] of a lot of room to add more fuel tonks anyways.

on the subject of adding things:
- the two extra core spaces are on the underside, one each side at the front - marked in neon pink.
- the rest of the expansions are in one big heavily armoured block at the back of the ship;
	::shield is marked in yellow
	::the rest is neon pink again.
- there's also  a single block space in the nose for whatever, convenient for further core, an rcs or some equip.
- you will also find a surprising number of duff blocks that no longer serve a purpose as armour, left over from the old "Levit8-Aero™ ablative armour" removal - careful investigation could allow heavy modding indeed...
  [i](this may even bring the possibility of reducing vanilla cpu cost sufficiently to allow it to run directly as spawned from factory- maybe try some investigation in creative sandbox god mode...)[/i]
  ...and ofc in vanilla you may not need [b]21[/b] generators churning out over 35kW designed to run shield setups in RE.

designed to have one of the two radars replaced with functioning in RE - they can be removed, were just for symmetry tbh.
it comes on the assumption you're installing shields so there's already a pentaxid tonk - needs removing if you ain't doin' warp or shields therefore.
has wifi, detector and reasonable cargo but no armour locker/fridge/medic/etc. - it's not designed for gen. purp. survival,  this is a very specific military use hyperfast picket type vehicle (admittedly i also find it convenient for dropship heavy sniper rifle big-game dino hunting too :P - remember, [b]don't shoot the babies![/i]).

═════════════

for RE, space for chargers and caps is back block in pink, shield in yellow, extra cores in pink as mentioned lower front sides in pink etc.

read above for everything else.

for RE nothing needs to be taken off, there's what should be right generators to run 2x [2:1] shield boost ratio but can actual cram even more in if you extend the back outwards, and add more gens n fuel. this would probly need yet another core in the third space front centre.

═════════════

design notes: wings complicate torque, calcs done using RE values - performance in vanilla is [i]nuts[/i]...

i actually had to create a spreadsheet anyways for the shield stuff cos chargers/capacitors so i added a section for the torques... oop.

The woflcorp. I/EAS-3lectron is a hyperfast Insert/Extract Assault Shuttle designed to work with RE 1.x requirements. The ship is at 100,000 CPU as spawns so requires extra cores to run and is designed to have a shield and boosters added. it requires level 25 technologies to build.

The 3lectron Class is an updated I/EAS with the sathium-reinforced steel composite Levit8-Aero™ ablative ultra-aerodynamic armour stripped off the front/upper and a total bare bones skeleton fitted out for consumer choice of shield/booster configuration. the shell of armour remains around the core/underside just for extra protection and as before there is no monocoque hull - the ship components are the structure. this particular ship is the 'Shogun' - a ship that distinguished itself by taking part in a spec. ops. mission to launch an EMP Cruise Missile from an extreme vector right through an atmospheric battle involving an Ares class battleship so allowing it to be stolen in a a blatant act of industrial espionage to then be upgraded in many ingenious ways. this I/EAS-3lectron had twin rail guns, a pair of pulse laser cannon instead of the traditional second pair of railguns and a central rocket launcher as well as the full complement of 4x minigun turrets. it was flown on the mission in question with 21 generators running an advanced heavy shield, 4 shield capacitors and 2 shield chargers with the rest of the ship entirely fuel tanks, all employing the latest in woflcorp. advanced upgraded shield technology.

so much ammo was loaded on there were two munitions storage boxes, and a full complement of every current small vessel scanning device.the vessel is set up to have a pilot in one cockpit whilst an archaically terrmed  'navigator' occupies the other. ofc. this navigator in fact is the systems specialist running weapons, scanning and general ship overall systems setup.

"so this is the actual one?"
"yup - flew right through an active battle, launched a cruise miss'le and cleared out without gettin caught!"
" damn - so that's what those big mount points are underneath - the missile brackets- a custom mounting?"
"yeah - thing can drag like 5kt so it dint even notice the weight of the miss'le and of course it don't affect aerodynamics none"
"whoawww... took down an Ares class on it's own, with no damage to the Ares class or even gettin' spotted - beautiful"
"we can take it out for a spin later if you like - it can flip all axes on it's own length full tilt!"
"hecc yeah - i'll grab the big rifle and we can go dino huntin in the forest!"
"sure thing!"
"anyways, let's start fuelling - again..."

barry here's a master of faking shipping manifests - we don't actually carry cargo, freight's just our cover


the ship is rustyn knackered.
the ship is old, rusty n knackered.
gemini super50's are ancient.
like pre-pod-system ancient.
they still used extension management to shuffle the cargo around and took forever to load.
tho that's not such an issue with these cos it takes a while for those enourmous pumps to pressure up the vessel in pod #no.50  out front.
the whole thing ofc is named cos there's 50 cargo holds total, including no.50 the pressure vessel.
but this vessel is unique.
this particular gemini super50 isn't a anormal bulk cargo freighter.
it's a smuggler base masquerading as a cargo vessel.
cargo bay #no.19 is a hangar door and inside lies 'the falcon' - a fast warp capable small vessel for jumping round systems and sneaking through near anywhere.
pitch black, unarmed to as not to trigger any detectors, and basically just a warpdrive with a cockpit, it can shift narcotics, documents, data, info, small items etc. very fast through near any net spread out to catch stuff more normal.
this particular smuggling base ofc is not just a single hangar and a load of empty cargo pods ue to false manifests. there's endless tons of space filled with all manner of things to support a crew of smugglers through their lives, although ofc being so clapped out and old it's not just a bit of an occasional saftey hazard - the thing is damn near haunted. in fact that wouldn't be a far cry considering the captain is a west indian origin with religious beliefs tending towards a likelihood as much to be sacrificing a chicken to some random deity as eating it for dinner. odd bundles of feathers and bowls of water with blood dripped in aside though, the ship does actually run veyr soundly and rarely raises suspicion as to being in anywaay a troublemaker, being slow they stick to the lesser shipping lanes and chug along ofc actually just serving as a launching platform for the falcon to do runs as and where needed.

ofc this gemini has a name, and no, it's not as the crew sometimes call it 'the long hedgehog'. it's the papa samuel, and she's ribbed - for your pleasure! :D
the papa samuel is interstellar warp capable and able t hold an immense amount of fuel not only aswould be necessary for a freighter to do long hauls but ofc the pressure vesssul up front isn't being used for freight of any sort so also store fuel for both the papa samuel herself s well as the falcons warp drive consumptions.

as is instantly obviousto a trained 'janes shipping trainspotter', a U.D.O. gemini super50 is ofc a variant of the LPK 'ling' class frighter but with atmospheric wings removed and no mning, tool or other functionals as well ofc asth significant difference -the nose end presusre vessel. the only significant interior difference is a slight bridge redesign to account for the raisd flak turrets due to the redesigned nose.

above all, it's a simple fact, if the original 'ling' class wasn't ugly enough, it's possible the gweminis are some of the ugliest ships out there...


of course in a clasic case of mixing it'll do with a lack of measure twice, cut once, the original papa samuel hangar was cobbled together by straight up slicing off a cargo pod protrusion and adding an 'acquired' hangar door. the problem is, the door wasn't actually wide enough for the falcon which had to hover and land sideways at the last moment to be docked. never amusing for a tired pilot. now fixed with a door twice as wide, although some fiddles with height were needed there ship can at least land.

as a result of some fun with drones on her last run the falcon herself has been fitted with moutns for optional armaments - a pair of gattling cannon or rail guns each side to provide some projectile capability.

falcon is a refitted dk hawk - stripped out crap like fridge and rcs and uncessary extras to mae room for extra gen, extra fuel, uprated engines and ofc when fitted the weapons are quite hefty as wdell as extra ammo

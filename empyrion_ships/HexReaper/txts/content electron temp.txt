The woflcorp. I/EAS-3lectron is a hyperfast Insert/Extract Assault Suttle designed to work with RE 1.x requirements. The ship is at 100,000 CPU as spawns so requires extra cores to run and is designed to have a shield and boosters added. it requires level 25 technologies to build.

The 3lectron Class is an updated I/EAS with the sathium-reinforced steel composite Levit8-Aeroâ„¢ ablative ultra-aerodynamic armour stripped off the front/upper and a total bare bones skeleton fitted out for consumer choice of shield/booster configuration. the shell of armour rmains around the core/underside jsut for extra protection and as before there is no monocoque hull - the ship components are the stucture. this particular ship is the 'Shogun' - a ship that distinguisheditself by taking part in a spec. ops. mission to launch an EMP Cruise Missile from an extreme vector right through an atmospheric battle involving an Ares class battleship so allowing it to be stolen in a a blatant act of industrial espionage to then be upgraded in many ingenious ways. this I/EAS-3lectronhas twin rail guns, a pair of pulse laser cannon instead of the traditional second pair of railguns and a central rocket launcher as well as the full complement of 4x minigun turrets. it was flown on the mission in question with 21 generators running an advanced heavy shield, 4 sheild chapacitors and 2 sheild chargers with the rst of the ship entirely fuel tanks, all employing the latest in woflcorp. advanced upgraded shield technology.

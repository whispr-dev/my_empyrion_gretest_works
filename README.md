this is an archive of my greatest achievements within my world of empyrion gaming - i .e. all th user content i generaterd for the steam workshop. mostly just wanted it archived a safely just in case something dire happened...

it's mostly designs for capitol and sm0l vessels but there's a hecca lotta fan fiction/creative stuff included in those packages that isnt't really attsacheable on steam workshop so is vulnerable to vanishing way too easily :< 

and yes, the video 'someoe stole the ares' is as absolutely ridiculus, hiilarious and priceless as you could possibly ever dare to dream - enjoy muchly i hope!

p.s. if you ever wanna get me talking ona  subject more openly and unguardedlythan any other to disarm me - here's the secret - get me onto empyion strategy and you've won the game easy sailign right thrpugh the posts!

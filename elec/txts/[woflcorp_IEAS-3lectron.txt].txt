[Vanilla:]
carries 5.01kt with no performance loss.
even can dust off full speed with 3.59ktonlight gravity planets!

min 22.1mN thrust on weakest axes, yet only weighs 87.5t no cargo (and yes, it has internalcargo capability aplenty as well as xternal mounts), means this thing is [i][b]HYPER[/b]fast[/i].

incredible pitch, roll, and yaw specs mean this thing flies better than any fighter in the fleet - even a woflcorp. modded X-Wing Starfighter!

less than 14x11x7m means it fis in pretty much any CV hangar known making it the ultimate dropship/shuttle.
in fact, you can fit two of em in a std. woflcorp ind. 30x15x10m freighter shipping crate! [i](this may prove convenient for more than just delivery commercially...)[/i]

[note: "Thrusters Left/Right" should read "2/2" - damn thing glitched gfx /shrug. it also blanked the attacc/defens n a few others - weird...]

don't be decieved by the triangle count - what isn't win or cockpit is thristers - i.e. faster throughput than the actual air flow aerodynamically over the skin would be - in other words most of what is 'square' speeds this thing up, not slows it down!


pls. note i emphasised strafe over yaw immensely so that's why it's the weaks est spec of the three manoeverings. the pitch and roll are immense still. :D


nb. meant fo fast in'n'outs - rescues, dropship duties, shuttling etc. - it carries a hefty buncha fuel, but it eats a hefty buncha fuels - you aint got long between refuels. inflight refuelling or filling cargos/increasing fuels as option expansion is wise.
in vanilla, since  there are no caps/chargers,  there's a [b]hecc[/b] of a lot of room to add more fuel tonks anyways.

on the subject of adding things:
- the two extra core spaces aron the underside, one eachside at the front - marked in neon pink.
- the rest of the expansiona are in one big heavily armoured block at the back of the ship;
	::shield is marked in yellow
	::the rest is neon pink again.
- there's also  a single block space in the nose for whatever, convenient for further core, an rcs or some equip.
- you will also find a surprising nuumber of duff blocks that no longer serve a purpose as armour, left over fom the old "Levit8-Aero™ ablative armour" removal - careful investigation could allow heavy modding indeed...
  [i](this may even bring the possibility of reducing vanilla cpu cost sufficiently to allow it to run directly as spawned from factory- maybe try some investigation in creative sandbox god mode...)[/i]
  ...and ofc in vanilla you may not need [b]21[/b] generators churning out over 35kW desinged to run shield setups in RE.

designed to have one of the two radars replaced with functioning in RE - thye can be removed, were just for symmetry tbh.
it comes on the assumption you're installing shields so there's already a pentaxid tonk - needs removing if you ain't doin' awrp or shields therefore.
has wifi, detector and reasonable cargo but no armour locker/fridge/medic/etc. - it's not designed for gen.purp. survival,  this is a very specific military use hyperfast picket type vehicle (admittedlyi also find it convenient for dropship heavy sniper rifle big-game dino hunting too :P - remember, [b]don't shoot the babies![/i]).


═════════════

for RE, space for chargers and caps is back block in pink, shield in yellow, extra cores in pink as mentioned lower front sides in pink etc.

read above for everything else.

for RE nothing needs to be taken off, there's what should be right generators to run 2x [2:1] shield boost ratio but can actual cram even more in ifyou extend the back out wardss, and add more gens n fuel. this would probly need yet another core in the third space front centre.

═════════════

design notes: wings complicate torque, calcs done using RE values - performance in vanilla is [i]nuts[/i]...

i actually had to create a spreadsheet anyways for the shield stuff cos chargers/capacitors so i added a section for the torques... oop.
